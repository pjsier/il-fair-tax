That's actually part of what the Fair Tax is trying to address! The majority of local school budgets in Illinois [comes from local property taxes](https://www.centerforilpolitics.org/articles/illinois-school-funding-a-prime-time-primer), and increasing the amount of education funding from the state is a necessary first step in reducing local property taxes.

The bill also includes an increase in the property tax credit from 5 percent to 6 percent, and up to a $100 per-child tax credit for couples earning less than $100,000 and single persons earning less than \$80,000. See [Public Act 101-0008](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0008) for more details.
