That's actually part of what the Fair Tax is trying to address! The majority of local school budgets in Illinois [comes from local property taxes](https://itep.org/low-tax-states-are-often-high-tax-for-the-poor/), and increasing the amount of funding from the state can start to reduce the property tax burden from local governments.

The bill also includes an increase in the property tax credit from 5 percent to 6 percent, and up to a $100 per-child tax credit for couples earning less than $100,000 and single persons earning less than \$80,000. See [Public Act 101-0008](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0008) for more details.
