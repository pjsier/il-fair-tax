Illinois doesn't currently tax retirement income and the Fair Tax amendment won't change that. In fact, [AARP Illinois is one of the many organizations supporting it](https://states.aarp.org/illinois/where-aarp-stands-on-il-graduated-income-tax-amendment). Without the revenue to fix our budget crisis through a graduated income tax, it's more likely that legislators will have to look into adding a tax on retirement income.
