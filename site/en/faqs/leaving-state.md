Illinois's population is shrinking, but according to an [analysis by the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability](https://budgetblog.ctbaonline.org/illinois-is-a-low-outmigration-state-and-other-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-people-moving-ce3f0cd6ab4c) there are actually _fewer_ people leaving the state than the national average. Rather than a massive "exodus", this is largely because of declining birth rates and immigration. On top of that, many of the top destinations for those who do leave the state have higher income taxes than Illinois does now.

While it's often used as a scare tactic, the idea that people can't wait to leave the state simply doesn't hold up. You can read more in [Curtis Black's column for the Chicago Reporter](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/the-fair-tax-amendment-why-the-illinois-exodus-could-be-a-red-herring/).
