Not according to this [report from the Center for Budget and Tax Accountability](https://budgetblog.ctbaonline.org/small-businesses-wont-suffer-because-of-the-fair-tax-9195c361324). Most small business income is referred to as "pass-through income" because it isn't treated any differently than personal income for small business owners. Only net income is taxed, and the vast majority of small businesses in the state are seeing annual net incomes of less than the \$250k threshold.
