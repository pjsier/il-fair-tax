Illinois will have to raise taxes or cut services. If we're stuck with a flat tax system, everyone's taxes will go up. If we switch to a graduated tax system, like many other states have, we can make sure that those who have the most pay the most instead of increasing rates across the board or slashing the budgets of essential services.
