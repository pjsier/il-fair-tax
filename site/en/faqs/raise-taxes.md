The legislature already has the power to change taxes any time, but the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability found [in their analysis of state taxes](https://budgetblog.ctbaonline.org/states-with-graduated-income-taxes-are-more-than-twice-as-likely-to-cut-taxes-as-to-raise-them-67a9603a96f7) that “states with graduated income taxes are more than twice as likely to cut taxes on the middle class as to raise them, (and have) cut taxes nearly two-and-a-half times more often than they have raised them on the middle class.”

If we're stuck with a flat tax system, we'll need to raise taxes for everyone and still make significant cuts to services. If we switch to a graduated tax system like the federal government and many other states already have, we can make sure that those who have the most pay the most while still providing essential services.
