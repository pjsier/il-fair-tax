## About the Fair Tax

With the current tax system in Illinois, low-income households pay almost twice as large a share of their income as some of the wealthiest people in the state [\[source<span class="visually-hidden"> report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy</span>\]](https://itep.org/whopays/illinois/). Meanwhile communities across the state don't have the revenue they need to support education, infrastructure, and health care. And the needs are more pressing than ever in the middle of a global pandemic.

We have a chance to change that in the upcoming election. By passing the Fair Tax amendment and updating the tax rates, we can raise more than \$3 billion a year by making sure households making more than \$250,000 (the wealthiest 3% of the state) pay their fair share with a small tax increase. You can make Illinois a more fair state for working people by voting yes for the Fair Tax.
